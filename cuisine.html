  <h3>Solkadhi</h3>

Popular in the Konkan regions, especially Goa, Mangalore and parts of coastal Maharashtra, it is made from coconut milk and dried kokum skins (agal/amsul), whose anthocyanin pigments provide a deep purple-pink colour.</p>

  <h3>Amboli</h3>
  <p>Malvani Amboli is a vegan and gluten-free Maharashtrian version of uttapam. Generally served for breakfast with some chutney. However, it can be enjoyed as a main meal with some spicy Kala Chana Amti (Black Chickpeas Curry) or chicken curry.Amboli is a thick pancake made with rice and urad dal, i.e. split black gram. Though enjoyed for breakfast it goes well for lunch or snacks too. Amboli I find is much softer than the uttapam. They are really light and have a melt-in-the-mouth texture.</p>
