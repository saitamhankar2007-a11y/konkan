Amboli is a small village in the southern Konkan Division, Sindhudurg district, Maharashtra state, India. Amboli Ghat lies at an altitude of approximately 700 metres (2,300 feet) above sea level and is the last hill resort before ending in the coastal plains of Goa state.[1]

Amboli lies in the Western Ghats of peninsular India, one of the world's "Ecological Hotspots"[citation needed] and it abounds in unusual flora and fauna. However, as in the other parts of the Sahaydri Hills, denudation of the forest cover and unregulated government-assisted development are gradually ruining a once-pristine environment.[original research?]

Historically, Amboli village came into being as one of the staging posts along the road from Vengurla port to the city of Belgaum, which was extensively used by the British to supply their garrisons in south and central India.

The source of the Hiranyakeshi river lies in the hills around Amboli village and farmers cultivate rice in it.[2] An ancient Shiva temple (called Hiranyakeshwar) sits at the cave where the water emerges.[citation needed] The main attraction for tourists is the incredibly-high rainfall (7 m average, per year) and the numerous waterfalls and mist during the monsoons. Legend has it that there are 108 Shiva temples in and around Amboli, of which only a dozen have been uncovered, one as recently as 2005.[citation needed] Amboli is also known for sending large number of youngsters to serve Indian Army. In Amboli, it is hard to find a house which doesn't have at least one person who is serving in Indian Army or has served Indian Army. Shahid Soldier Pandurang Mahadev Gawade was also from Amboli, who attained martyrdom while fighting five Lashkar terrorists at Drug Mulla village in Kashmir's Kupwara district on May 22, 2016, was posthumously awarded Shaurya Chakra on the eve of 68th Republic Day. Additionally, the interesting fact of the village is that many men had also served for British army in the pre-independence era.
